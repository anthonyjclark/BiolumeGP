# how to run biolumes and manager
The manager:   run 'python manager.py' on one computer.
Running this will output the commands that must be run to start the Biolumes (see function Manager.start_biolumes()).

The biolume:   run 'python biolumeSerial_v3.py <ip address of the manager computer> <biolume id> -ds' on the RPis.
-ds is optional, for if you want to run it without the sensors.
There is also a biolume_info.cv file that the manager program reads from. If you want the manager to be able to send messages back to the biolume you'll have to change the info listed here. Something like:

    ipAddress,x,y
    10.0.1.34,1,0

should work for you.

# how to install libraries used in biolume code
To install PyAudio: (instructions from http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=25173)
(we won't need this when mic on the shield is working)
	sudo apt-get install git
	sudo git clone http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/git/pyaudio.git
	sudo apt-get install libportaudio0 libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0 portaudio19-dev
	sudo apt-get install python-dev (?)
	sudo apt-get install python-dev-all
	cd pyaudio
	sudo python3 setup.py install

To install PyGame: (instructions from http://www.pygame.org/wiki/compileUbuntu?parent=index)
	#install dependencies

This directory contains the SD card image of the SD card I have been using on the RPi.

This card already has been set up for wireless internet, for remote access via a VNC server, and all the other things written in RPiHowTo.rtf.

So, if you do not want to go through all the setup steps that I described, they you can burn this image to an SD card using a program like Win32DiskImager, and boot the RPi from it.

I recommend that "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get upgrade" be run before trying anything else after booting from this SD card.

This directory contains code and a makefile for doing face detection with OpenCV.

The makefile is set up so that it can link with OpenCV libraries. To compile the code run "make faceDetect".

haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml is a file I copied from the OpenCV directory.

The code itself I found online and simplified. What it does is output to the terminal the number of faces detected by the camera plugged into RaspberryPi.

I used a Playstation Eye when I ran this code.

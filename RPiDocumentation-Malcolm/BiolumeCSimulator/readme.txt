This code is based on the Biolume simulator written in Java, but it is written in C instead.

For the most part it is very similar to the Java simulator except that its display is very simple - just outup to the terminal that shows the display of each Biolume in the population.
Besides that, this code is a lot simpler that the simulator code in Java. I.e. it does not have many of the optional functions that the Java simulator has.

More information on the code is written in the documentation in the code files.

To run this code first compile by running "make BiolumeSimulator" and then run "./BiolumeSimulator".
